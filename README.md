Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is one of the most critical phases in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). 
It involves identifying, gathering, and analyzing the needs or expectations of the users, clients, and stakeholders for a software project. 
The main goal is to clearly understand what the system should do before any design or coding begins.

Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1. Prevents Misunderstandings and Scope Creep:
Requirement Analysis ensures that developers, clients, and stakeholders all share the same understanding of what the software should do. This prevents confusion, reduces changes later in the project, and keeps the project within scope.

2. Saves Time and Cost:
Identifying and resolving requirement issues early is much cheaper and faster than fixing problems after development has started. Proper analysis helps avoid rework, delays, and wasted resources.

3. Improves Software Quality and User Satisfaction:
When user needs and expectations are clearly understood and documented, the final product is more likely to meet or exceed those expectations. This leads to a higher-quality system and greater user satisfaction.
