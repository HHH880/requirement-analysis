Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is one of the most critical phases in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). 
It involves identifying, gathering, and analyzing the needs or expectations of the users, clients, and stakeholders for a software project. 
The main goal is to clearly understand what the system should do before any design or coding begins.
